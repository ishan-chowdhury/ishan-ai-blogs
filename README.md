# Ishan’s AI Blogs 

This repository contains my technical blogs on **Search Algorithms**, **Artificial Intelligence concepts**, and **AI problem-solving puzzles**.

The goal of this project is to explain AI ideas in a **clear, structured, and intuitive way**, combining theory, code, and visual intuition.

All blogs are written in **Markdown** using Obsidian and published via **GitHub Pages**.
