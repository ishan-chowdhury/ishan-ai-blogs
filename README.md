# Ishan’s AI Blogs

This repository is a collection of blog posts where I write about **Artificial Intelligence**, especially **search algorithms**, core AI concepts, and interesting problem-solving puzzles.

I started this project mainly to document what I’m learning, explain ideas in my own words, and build a small technical writing portfolio along the way.

All the blogs are written in Markdown (using Obsidian) and published with GitHub Pages.

## What’s in Here?

### Search Algorithms
You’ll find posts on algorithms like:

- BFS and DFS  
- Uniform Cost Search  
- Greedy Best-First Search  
- A* Search  
- Comparisons between different search strategies  

Each blog usually includes:
- A simple explanation  
- Key properties (like optimality and completeness)  
- Some code (mostly Python)  
- Worked examples

### AI Concepts
I also write about general AI topics such as:

- How problems are formulated in AI  
- What heuristics are and why they matter  
- How agents make decisions  
- Basic planning and reasoning ideas  

These are mostly focused on understanding the *thinking* behind AI, not just the math.

### AI Puzzles & Problem Solving
Some posts are based on classic AI puzzles like:

- The 8-Puzzle  
- Water Jug Problem  
- Missionaries and Cannibals  
- Other logic and search-based problems  

These are fun to solve and really help in understanding how search algorithms work in practice.

## Tools I Use

- Markdown (with Obsidian)  
- GitHub Pages for hosting  
- Mermaid for diagrams  
- LaTeX for equations  
- Python for examples  

Nothing fancy — just simple tools that get the job done.

## Why This Repo Exists

This repository is mainly for:

- Tracking my AI learning journey  
- Practicing technical writing  
- Sharing explanations that are easy to follow  
- Building a small personal knowledge base  

If someone else finds it helpful too, that’s a bonus 🙂
